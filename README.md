## Microsoft Dynamics 365 Announces Industry Accelerators

Dynamics 365 announced the Microsoft Power Platform, a connected app platform that unifies access to your data to enable ISVs, SIs, Partners and Customers to build intelligent, data driven, task focused business and analytic applications. Microsoft is focused on enabling a data culture where the Microsoft Power Platform acts as the glue across Dynamics 365 (CE, F&O, Talent), Office 365 (SharePoint, Teams), Power BI, Power Apps, Microsoft Flow, Azure and other 3rd party on-premise and cloud based solutions.

With the Power Platform providing a unified approach to building data driven solutions, the team is taking it one step further by introducing Industry Solution Accelerators. Accelerators are industry focused foundational components that enable ISVs and other solution providers, a way to build solutions that are based on industry standards supported and driven by Microsoft. Along with our Health Accelerator that was released during Inspire 2018, which you can read about here, we are focused on delivering accelerators for the following industries (but not limited too):

## Overview of the Industry Nonprofit Accelerator

Central to our approach to serving nonprofits is our commitment to building a Common Data Model, publishing that openly and working across platforms. This enables powerful interoperability to fuel greater insights and efficacy, while also providing true data transparency.  We have incorporated all the best practices the CDM represents into the Dynamics 365 Nonprofit Accelerator which is a set of capabilities and standards to help drive greater impact.  We are committed to helping nonprofits around the world implement these best practices consistently and efficiently and by incorporating the CDM into the Accelerator, what once required customization is standard today.   

Learning from data model challenges of the past and design a streamlined, open foundation for vendors, partners and nonprofits to rapidly build applications and connectors. 

Harnessing the power of the Microsoft technology stack - Azure, Office 365, Power Platform, Dynamics 365, Power BI - alongside the interoperability is the nonprofit CDM will save nonprofits time and money better spent in their missions

The Microsoft Common Data Model for Nonprofits is the first of its kind to provide a model that reflects industry best-practices and insight across program delivery, grant/award management, constituent management, fundraising, and donation management.
